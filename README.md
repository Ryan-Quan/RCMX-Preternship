Developed multiple algorithms for equities trading based on technical indicators:
  * Strategy 1 (VWAP Cross): Long position when the VWAP rises above the price and short position when the VWAP falls below the price​
  * Strategy 2 (VWAP Mean Reversion): Long position when the price moves a certain percentage (1%) away from the VWAP​
  * Strategy 3 (Exponential Moving Averages): Long when the fast moving average rises above the slow moving and short the other way​
  * Strategy 4 (VWAP-TWAP Cross): Similar to the first strategy, but incorporates the TWAP into strategy​
  
Used:
  * Alpha-Vantage API
  * Jupyter notebook
  * Pandas/NumPy
